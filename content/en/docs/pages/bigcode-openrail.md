Open Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL) are licenses designed to permit free and open access, re-use, and downstream distribution of modifications of AI artifacts, for research, commercial or non-commercial purposes, as long as the use restrictions present in the license agreement always apply (including to modified material). For more information, please access the RAIL Initiative [post](https://www.licenses.ai/blog/2022/8/18/naming-convention-of-responsible-ai-licenses).

## Why Open?
The term “Open” is to indicate that the license agreement enables royalty free access, downstream use and re-distribution of the licensed material, and distribution of any modifications of it.

You can use any type of legal agreement you want to share the model or modifications of it. This will be possible under the sole conditions of including in the legal agreement:
the license agreement paragraph related to the responsible use of the model (i.e., paragraph 4) or a similar provision that accomplishes the same purpose, and, 
the use restrictions (i.e., Attachment A) or a similar set of restrictions that accomplish the same purpose.

See FAQ below: “Do use restrictions apply to modifications of the model?”.

## Responsible?
Responsible AI licensing is a mechanism that is part of -and interacting with- a broader system of AI governance instruments and processes, such as Model Cards and regulations.
