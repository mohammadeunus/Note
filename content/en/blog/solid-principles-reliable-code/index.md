# SOLID Principles: The Core of My Most Reliable Code

When I first started out as a developer, my code worked—but it wasn’t always easy to maintain, extend, or debug. That changed when I discovered the SOLID principles. In this post, I’ll share how these five simple guidelines became the backbone of my most reliable code, with real examples from projects I’ve worked on.

## What Are the SOLID Principles?
A quick refresher:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Why SOLID Matters
- Maintainability
- Flexibility
- Testability
- Fewer bugs

## Real Project Example: [Project/Feature Name]
- The problem before SOLID
- How I applied [one or more] SOLID principles
- The improvement/result

## Principle-by-Principle: How I Use SOLID
### Single Responsibility Principle
- Example from a real class/service

### Open/Closed Principle
- Example of extending functionality without modifying existing code

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- Example of using inheritance or interfaces safely

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Example of keeping interfaces focused and clean

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- Example of decoupling code for easier testing and maintenance

## Lessons Learned
- How SOLID changed my approach
- Tips for applying SOLID in your own projects

## Conclusion
SOLID isn’t just theory—it’s the core of my most reliable code. If you want maintainable, flexible, and robust software, start with SOLID.
