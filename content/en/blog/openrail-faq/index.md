# What is an OpenRAIL license?
Open Responsible AI Licenses (OpenRAIL) are licenses designed to permit free and open access, re-use, and downstream distribution of derivatives of AI artifacts, for research, commercial or non-commercial purposes, as long as the use restrictions present in the license always apply (including to derivative works). For more information, please access the RAIL Initiative post.
